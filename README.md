## This repo

Each day I will (try to) solve a puzzle for each day.

The **programming language of my choice is Python**. 
Who knows... Maybe I'll solve these puzzles in other languages in future.

The ```create_folder.py``` script will create a folder for each day and copy the template files into it.

Each folder ~~has~~ should have a solution for part 1 and part 2 of each day and its input text file.

In the project root, there's a ```test.py``` that can run a solution for a particular day.

```bash
python test.py {day_number} {part_number}
```

*I just make things up as I go.*
